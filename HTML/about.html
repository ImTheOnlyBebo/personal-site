			<h2>Work Ethic</h2>
			<p>My experience in construction has profoundly influenced my approach to website development. Hereâ€™s how the
				skills and work ethic honed in construction play a crucial role in my web development practice:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Attention to Detail:</strong> In construction, precision is vital. This same attention to detail
					ensures that every aspect of a website is meticulously crafted, from the layout to the functionality.</li>
				<li><strong>Problem-Solving Skills:</strong> Construction projects often present unforeseen challenges. The
					ability to think on my feet and devise effective solutions translates directly to troubleshooting and
					optimizing websites.</li>
				<li><strong>Strong Work Ethic:</strong> Construction work is physically demanding and requires dedication. This
					instilled a strong work ethic in me, which I apply to ensure that web development projects are completed on
					time and to the highest standard.</li>
				<li><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Building a ski lift or working on an oil rig involves collaboration
					with diverse teams. Similarly, I work effectively with designers, clients, and other developers to bring a
					shared vision to life.</li>
				<li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> The dynamic nature of construction projects requires adaptability, a trait
					that helps me stay flexible and responsive to changing client needs and emerging web technologies.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By integrating these principles into my web development practice, I ensure that every project I undertake is
				executed with the same level of commitment, precision, and excellence that characterized my previous work.</p>
